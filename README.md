# CNV_QC

Creating an awesome tool to perform CNV QC on WES data independent of callers/platform that focuses on confidence and reportability of CNV calls, particularly in clinical data.

## Motivation:
* CNV callers based on WES frequently produce noisy/false positive calls
* Validating these calls involves MPLA/external tools: time + memory 
## Solution: 
* Unified independent set of metrics for QCing CNV calls
* Identify false positive calls 
* Enable cross callers comparison

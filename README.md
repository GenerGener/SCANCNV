# CNV_QC

Creating an awesome tool to perform CNV QC on WES data independent of callers/platform that focuses on confidence and reportability of CNV calls, particularly in clinical data.

## Problem Statement
* CNV callers based on WES frequently produce noisy/false positive calls
* Validating these calls involves MPLA/external tools: time + memory
